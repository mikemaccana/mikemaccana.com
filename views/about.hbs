<div class="about-me">
	<h2>What exactly do you do?</h2>
	<p>I work across a complete range of layers in a wide range of roles. I've been working in technology for nearly two decades now, currently as a product manager, but also have experience from hardware to low latency kernel tuning for trading desks, to large scale cloud virtualization, middleware architecture, to backend design to mobile web UX.</p>

	<h2>Speaking at Your Event</h2>
	<p>I am an experienced professional trainer and have also spoken at conferences to audiences ranging from lawyers to web developers to Linux kernel engineers. Check out some of my past presentations on Speakerdeck. </p>

	<h2>Working Together</h2>
	<p>If you have something specific in mind, the bets thing is to contact me via email. Regrettably I do not have the time to respond to every enquiry - if interested, I will get back to you.</p>

	</p>If you'd just like to keep in contact, I'd be delighted if you would <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=mikemaccana">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
